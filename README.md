# About
The goal of this project was to create a game that would help teach children about composting and how it can affect the environment.
The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JS to allow an interactive game with drag/drop elements.

# How To Play
The game has multiple pictures of compostable items that the user will have to drag and drop to the compost bin to help Benji the Bunny gather compost.


Benji the Bunny is here to help explain how the game works:
An important instruction will appear in the text box. After the user has finished reading what Benji has to say, they can select the Next button to read the next instruction.
If the user needs to go back for whatever reason, they can select the Previous button. Once the user finishes the Tutorial, the Select Game Mode button will appear. 

Once the user clicks Select Game Mode button, they can choose between two separate Game Modes: Classic and Extreme.

In the Classic mode, the items that the user will have to move to the compost bin will be stationary and will automatically regenerate once all items have been moved to the bin.
In the Extreme Mode, the items will appear in random locations of the game window and will disappear shortly after they displayed. 

In both game modes, the user has 30 seconds to drag as many compost items into the compost bin. Compete with yourself or others to see who gets the highest score!


# Compost Resources
Since the game was made for the University of Pittsburgh, the development team decided to add multiple local composting resources for our local community members to utilize. Feel free to check these useful links out below the game window.
